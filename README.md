**R7	Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.**

Often due to natural calamities or administrative process delays, medical facilities face a shortage of necessary regularly used medical equipment. This website will help bring multiple vendors who sell medical equipment online with the medical facility owners. This way medical healthcare facilities don't have to rely upon their fixed vendors and have access to multiple suppliers. Also, medical facilities that have an abundant supply or availability of medical devices can lease these devices to other medical facilities which will help reduce the cost and time for purchase and can be immediately used for patient care in difficult times.

**R8	Why is it a problem that needs solving?**

It has been observed that in many countries across the world healthcare facilities have experienced a huge shortage of medical equipment during the COVID pandemic. This has burdened the medical system and decreased the operational flow. This has led to challenging situations for doctors and nurses to treat their patients effectively with the limited supply of medical equipment.
